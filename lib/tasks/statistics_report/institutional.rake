Global stats for monthly report

    New/unique users (/month)
    Total n users
    New completed plans (/month)
    Total n completed plans
    New plans with public visibility (/month)
    Total n public plans 
    New institutions (/month)
    Total n institutions (excluding Non-Partner Institution)
    (Public) template of the month (public template with highest frequency of use/month)
    New plans/public template (/month)
    Total plans/public template

And something like this, but Iâ€™m open to suggestions

    Top 10? Institutions by users
    Top 10? Institutions by plans
