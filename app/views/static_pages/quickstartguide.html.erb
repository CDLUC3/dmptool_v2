	<p>After logging in, you will be taken to your <strong>My Dashboard</strong> page, click the <strong>Create New DMP</strong> button below the &ldquo;Overview&rdquo; box or in the navigation bar next to <strong>My DMPs</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>There are four steps in the workflow for creating a DMP:</p>
	<p><strong>Step #1: DMP Overview:</strong> provide general information about the plan, including template name, DMP title, co-owners, etc. </p>
	<p><strong>Step #2: DMP Details:</strong> provide answers to prompts in your DMP. Click the box size links to fully display section instructions.</p>
	<p><strong>Step #3: DMP Preview &amp; Completion:</strong> preview the DMP with options to print and download; plan is designated as &ldquo;Completed&rdquo;.</p>

	<h3>Step #1: DMP Overview</h3>
	<p>You can either: (A) Create a new DMP using a DMP Template; or (B) Copy an existing DMP.</p>
	<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ia4KnTFz0WngE5tbBNcal-0GcIkkxPFs-JG9D5Asi0EglXyigOht3uhG3BMxHTlASeI33JW7il7LK8tX3Ju3HXAT1N9iho8r8UsAFsJ6bnc1QilWTDdj20wgvSE" alt="Create New DMP" width="624px;" height="265px;"/></p>
	<h4>(A) Start from a DMP Template</h4>
	<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kqMiejks7toqngOJd5VbUWGoTiECTqmAZ1soOsGh9KiTDhwgMrBqESPbaczD0hKNxgAnMLJ9KMVdouoI3nSt_qoxGe0tF0ZOQy4XyJdx7Fk7F69Z6hD854VgvlQ" alt="Select DMP Template" width="352px;" height="373px;"/></p>
	<p>1. Click &nbsp;the &ldquo;Select Template&rdquo; button.</p>
	<p>2. Either browse by or search for a template plan name.</p>
	<p>Note: In the A-Z browse list, the folder icons and arrows to the left are clickable to view all templates within the folder.</p>
	<p>Note: These templates include those that are customized by your institution.</p>
	<p>3. Select the template appropriate for your funder or institution and click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;.</p>
	<h4>(B) Copy an Existing DMP</h4>
	 <p>The list of existing DMPs includes those that you own or co-own as well as those that are visible to everyone at your institution or are publicly available. Select a DMP and click &ldquo;Copy this DMP&rdquo;.</p>

	<p>After completing (A) or (B), enter the relevant information on the <strong>DMP Overview</strong> page.</p>
	<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JBWKIfOuKA9ptrVDmyRCPCH2SckW092_ZE6mbQgSynQR0vxiibCOKZ_eIchjZUmDf0YTSNez0-f78Jj1w6mal3SEy6T_3gsX5ck4G144_spvTbBBYBgiEmAKmaU" alt="DMP Overview" width="624px;" height="323px;"/></p>
	<p><strong>Enter the following information:</strong></p>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>DMP Title</strong>. The name should help you identify this specific data management plan and will be listed on the &ldquo;My DMPs&rdquo; page. Often DMP titles are similar to project titles.</li>
	  <li><strong>Proposal Solicitation Number (optional)</strong>. Enter the funder solicitation number, if available. This information does not &nbsp;appear in your final DMP.</li>
	  <li><strong>Proposal Submission Deadline (optional)</strong>. Enter the grant submission deadline.</li>
	  <li><strong>Visibility</strong>. Indicate your preference for DMP visibility. By default, visibility is &ldquo;private&rdquo; and can only be viewed by you and your plan co-owners. Other options are &ldquo;public&rdquo;: viewable by everyone; &nbsp;and &ldquo;institutional&rdquo;: viewable by everyone from your institution.</li>
	  <li><strong>Add Co-owners (optional)</strong>. Designate DMP co-owner(s), who will be able to view, edit, and comment on your plan. They must already have a DMPTool account to be designated a co-owner.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Click &ldquo;Save and Next&rdquo;.</p>

	<h3>Step #2. DMP Details </h3>

	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Template Outline</strong>. You can navigate among different sections of a template using this outline. As you click a section title in the outline on the left, the prompts, resources, and text box for your answers will appear on the right.</li>
	  <li><strong>Instructions</strong>. There is <strong>Guidance</strong> for each section of the DMP. There may also be a <strong>Links</strong> tab where you will find links to further information, a <strong>Suggested Response</strong> tab with answers that you can simply copy and paste (not shown), and/or <strong>Example Response</strong> tab to help guide you in writing your response (not shown).</li>
	  <li><strong>Funder</strong> or <strong>Institution requirement</strong> statement. These are instructions directly from the funder or institution that is requiring the DMP.</li>
	  <li><strong>Text box</strong>. Your answers go here. The text box offers a few editing features (located above the text entry box). </li>
	  <li><strong>Save Response</strong>. Click &ldquo;Save Response&rdquo; to save your response and remain in the current section. &nbsp;Click the &ldquo;Save and Next&rdquo; button to navigate to the next section in your DMP. </li>
	</ol>
	<p>To navigate to other sections of your DMP, use the section links in the Outline in the box on the left. Be sure to save your response before leaving a section.</p>
