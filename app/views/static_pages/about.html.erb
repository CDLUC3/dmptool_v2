	<h1> About the DMPTool </h1>
	<h2>Why the DMPTool?</h2>
	<p>Scholarly researchers today are increasingly required to engage in a range of data management activities to comply with institutional policies, or as a precondition for publication or grant funding. Data management plans are now a standard part of grant proposals for most funding agencies. To aid researchers in creating effective data management plans (DMPs), a group of organizations collaborated on the development of the DMPTool, an online application that helps researchers create data management plans. The DMPTool provides detailed guidance and links to general and institutional resources and walks a researcher through the process of generating a comprehensive plan tailored to specific DMP requirements.

	<h2>DMPTool Background</h2>
	<p>The original DMPTool was a grassroots effort, beginning in January 2011 with eight institutions partnering to provide in-kind contributions of personnel and development. The effort was in direct response to demands from funding agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), that researchers plan for managing their research data. By joining forces the contributing institutions are able to consolidate expertise and reduce costs in addressing data management needs.

	<p>Since its release in October 2011, the DMPTool has generated huge interest among the science and library community, including its appearance on the Library of Congress' Top 10 Digital Preservation Developments of 2011. As of November 2013, more than 6,000 users from over 600 institutions have used the DMPTool. Given the success of the first version of the DMPTool, the founding partners obtained funding from the <a title="Alfred P. Sloan Foundation" href="http://sloan.org" target="_blank">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> to create a second version of the tool, released in 2014.

	<h3>Steering Group</h3>
	<p>The DMPTool Steering Group is a small coordinating body composed of persons elected from the original DMPTool partner institutions. The DMPTool Steering Group directs the technical, content, and community development of the DMPTool. If your institution is a partner and you are interested in joining the Steering Group, please 
	<%= link_to "Contact Us", contact_path, :title => "Contact Us" %>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Partner Institutions</h2>
	<p>Partner institutions can configure the tool to point to their resources and services, provide customized help, and provide suggested answers to the questions asked by funding agencies. DMPTool users affiliated with partner institutions can login with their own institutional accounts. For a list of current partner institutions, including local contact information, see 
	<%= link_to "Partner Institutions", partners_path, :title => "Partners" %>.

  <!--<p> U.S. funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health require researchers to supply detailed, cost-effective plans for managing research data, called Data Management Plans.</p>
  <p> Several universities and organizations are developing the DMPTool to help researchers meet these new requirements. In specific, the DMPTool will help researchers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Create ready-to-use data management plans for specific funding agencies </li>
    <li> Meet requirements for data management plans </li>
    <li> Get step-by-step instructions and guidance for data management plan </li>
    <li> Learn about resources and services available at your institution to fulfill the data management requirements of their grants </li>
  </ul>
  <hr/>
  <h1> Get Started </h1>
  <p>Click on the <%= link_to("Get Started", '#')%> button on the Home page. If your institution is one of our partner institutions, select it from the dropdown list. You may be directed to your own institution's login page, or you may be asked to create an account. If your institution is not listed, you can still create an account and use the DMPTool. Once you've set up an account, select My Plans from the navigation bar to begin a data management plan.

  <h1> DMP Tool Partners </h1>
  <h3>Joining forces to consolidate expertise and help researchers</h3>
  <p>
    A group of major research institutions has partnered to create a flexible online tool to help researchers generate data management plans. This effort is in direct response to demands from funding agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), that researchers plan for managing their research data.  By joining forces the contributing institutions are able to consolidate expertise and reduce costs in addressing data management needs. The primary goal of the partnership is to simplify the process of creating plans while increasing the quality of decisions made by funders to pre-define policies and infrastructures that support research activities.
  </p>
  <p> This is the list of original contributing institutions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/">The University of California Curation Center (UC3)<a/> at the <a href ="http://www.cdlib.org"> California Digital Library</a></li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.dataone.org">DataONE</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/">Digital Curation Centre (UK)</a></li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.si.edu">Smithsonian Institution</a></li>

    <li> <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu">University of Virginia Library</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Become a Contributing Institution </h3>
  <p>Contributing institutions can submit information pointing to their resources and services to aid researchers with data management. Institutions can also provide customized help and even suggest answers to the questions asked by funding agencies. The
    <a href="http://dmp.cdlib.org/help/video_demo">video demo</a> shows how local resources and services appear to researchers using the DMPTool.</p>
  <p>
    Persons affiliated with contributing institutions can login with their own institutional accounts. Persons not affiliated with contributing institutions will need to set up an account on the DMP Tool itself. See the <%=link_to("Login", choose_institution_path) %> page for more information.
